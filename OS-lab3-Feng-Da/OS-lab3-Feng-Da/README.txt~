This lab is written in java, first packed into tar.gz file created by 7-Zip. But after a revise I put the useful folder into a Zip file. Other folders automatically created by IDE are removed now.

File comment: one main function with the name Main.java. There will be hints about how inputting the file.


Compilation and running: Get into the folder Banker, then type in the command: javac Main.java, after having compiled java Main then the program starts with informing "Program Starts!" with following input the file path.


Directory hierarchy:root includes a folder named Banker in which all source code, input files and compiled classes are located. The root also includes a README file.


A short description of each file:
Two deadlock methods are listed as their name: Bank.java and Fifo.java.
Task.java, class that defines the task class members, attributes and methods.
BlockQueue.java is where the defination of the blocked queue locates.
Main.java is the entrance of the program and where processing reading and the two methods.

After read in the task file then system will initialize a task array and some necessary attributes of the two methods. The FIFO is processed first, after which all tasks will be reseted to unstarted states and then continue Bank algorithms.

I have commented the main thought in the source code and all methods are with the same name as the algorithm shows.
