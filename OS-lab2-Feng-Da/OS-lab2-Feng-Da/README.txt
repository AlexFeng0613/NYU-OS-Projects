This lab is written in java, tar.gz file created by 7-Zip.

File comment: one Scheduleing tar file, which is the main function. After compiling there will be hints about inputting the file and whether you wanna see the berbose information.


Compilation and running: just decompress the file, one is the ReadME file and the other is the program.


Directory hierarchy:root includes src folder in which all program files are located. This folder also includes a folder named Random Numbers, with a Random Number.txt in it, which is used for generating the random numbers.


A short description of each file:
Four files are with the name whose initial is ComparatorBy, these are classes implements the comparator interface, used for sorting and arranging the order.
Four schedule methods are listed as their name.
PrintOut.java, System print the result of the scheduling result.
Scheduling is where the main function locates.

I have also written the function that can display the random number, but I commented them. If you like you can remove the comment symbol thus they can be displayed.
